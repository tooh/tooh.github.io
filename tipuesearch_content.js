I Googled around to find a solution and although I found some possible solutions I still have the problem. I have also a notebook backing up to the same Synology and this backup is fast as ever. After many hours the backup is completed and now it seems stuck for hours in verifying the backup. Finally the backup was completed but the verification took a long time as well and was stuck on 69%. I am suspecting a hardware problem, possibly the harddisk. Diskutil did not report anything strange. My HD is a Seagate HD thas qualifies for the replacement program, I missed the 3 year deadline, so now I am stuck with this disk. Software Diagnostics {% docs tip %} You can try to run some standard diagnostics tools to eliminate some basic causes. Spotlight diagnostics sudo mdsdiagnose Time machine diagnostics sudo tmdiagnose Hardware Diagnostics Next step is to run the Apple Hardware Test ( AHT ). Reboot and press D before the grey screen. Conclusion I noticed from the activity monitor that there were several postfix background processes running. These were initiated because I had OSX Server running on this machine as well. Although the email service was not activitated in the configuration, it seemed that these processes were running altogether. I decided to deinstall OSX server and see what would happen. After deinstalling OSX server it seems that my Time Machine backup is running as normal. My analysis is that these postfix processes caused some constant file io which interfered somehow with Spotlight/Time Machine.","tags":"articles","url":"https://blog.florijnconsultancy.nl/articles/slow-time-machine-backup-on-mavericks.html","loc":"https://blog.florijnconsultancy.nl/articles/slow-time-machine-backup-on-mavericks.html"},{"title":"\" Reset Fritz!

On this TV you can install the Plex app from the Samsung App store. Out of the box the App was not able to find and connect to my Plex Media server ( PMS ) on my OSX Mavericks machine. In this post I describe how to open up the firewall in order to make this setup work. Samsung Plex app and Plex Media server Preparation Make sure the PMS runs on port 32400, none other will work. Make sure the PMS and the SAMSUNG TV are on the same subnet where only the x differs like in this example: 192.168.0.xxx Make sure \"Require authentication on local networks\" is unchecked on the PMS > Settings > myPlex > Advanced settings Make sure you are using fixed IP addresses that don't change. You can do so in your router DHCP settings. Find the MAC address and assign it a IP that it should use. Make sure no firewall software is blocking access to your PMS OSX firewall ON I prefer to leave the Application Firewall ( ALF ) on. Normal procedure to open up ports for a specific app would be to add the application to the Firewall. 1. Click the Firewall tab in the Security pane . 2. Click the Advanced button . 3. Click the + symbol . 4. Find the program that you ' d like to add as an exception . 5. Click the Add button . 6. Repeat the above step s for each program you ' d like to add to the exceptions list . 7. Set whether to Allow incoming connections or Block incoming connections for the programs in your list by clicking the up or down arrows to the far right of the program name , then selecting the appropriate option . 8. Click OK . 9. Close the Security pane saving your selections . For some reason this was not sufficient and I could not connect to my PMS server Firewall rules OSX contains a number of firewalls ( ALF , ipfw and pf) MacSec_Firewalls PMS blocked ? For some reason I could not connect and I disabled the ALF firewall. But still I could not connect. I executed the following steps and suddenly I could connect (with the ALF firewall turned on). A couple of days later I found out that even without the rule active (Note: Adding the firewall rule as described does not make the rule stick, you have to add that to a ipfw.conf file) I can connect to the PMS from my SAMSUNG TV and my SAMSUNG BD -D6500. I can not explain this. In any case it was interesting to investigate some firewall stuff. So use this info as is. Add rule to let Samsung TV communicate with PMS I used info from this outdated page www.ibiblio.org PMS is default connecting on port 32400 Look up the IP of your Samsung TV and change the below line accordingly: sudo ipfw add allow tcp from 192.168.1.0/24 to any dst-port 32400 in {% endcodeblock %} Result After adding this firewall rule and entering the IP address of my PMS server the SAMSUNG app connected succesfully and I was able to play my media.

Installation went smoothly and within an hour the basic things were working as expected. I wanted to access the NAS also from the internet, so I used the EZ -Internet wizard to configure it. I created a synology.me account and created a DDNS entry. For some reason the portforwarding on my Netgear WNDR3700 was not working as expected. Some people hinted that you could make some manual portforwarding rules, so I decided to give that a try. When I tried to create a custom service I got an error: \"The specified port(s) are being used by other configurations. Please check your configurations of USB Readyshare, Remote Management, Port forwarding, Port Triggering, UPnP Port Mapping table, RIP, and Internet connection type \" I noticed that the port 5000 was already appearing in my uPnP table and I assumed this was the cause of this error. I decided to switch off UPnP and then added the forwarding rule. Bingo! I could add the rule and the forwarding is working OK now. So my conclusion for now is that for some reason the EZ -Internet wizard is not working OK and does not detect that the forwarding rules were not applied correctly.
